This directory contains the backends for enthrall.
It will treat any file which starts with "enthrall." and ends
in the spell-name of the windowmanager/menu-tool as a
backend.

Take a look at the available backends to see how to build your own.

NOTE: windowmaker has 2 menu formats, the old menu and the new "plmenu"
      the default is to use the plmenu format, which is what enthrall will use.
      if you want to use the "old" format, you'll need to swap enthrall.windowmaker
      with wmaker.menu (remember to back enthrall.windowmaker).
      Before you ask, NO, I will not change enthrall to be able to build both as
      that would require too much of a rewrite. Maybe, just maybe, i'll think
      of something when all the other backends are done. Don't hold your breath...
